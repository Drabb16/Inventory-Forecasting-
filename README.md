# Machine Learning for Retail Deman Forecasting
## Demand Planning Optimization 
For many retailers, demand planning systems follow a traditional rule-based approach to forecast and replenish orders. Such an approach is adequate for stable and predictable product categories, however, it is limited for optimization. This is especially true for products with a high stockout cost. The goal of this project is to accurately forecast demand for each item at each store to ensure each of the ten stores is properly stocked too meet demand while minimizing deliveries and inventory cost. 
## Benefits
<ul>Inventory Optimization: matching store inventory with actual needs to reduce storage space needed (Rental Costs)</ul>
<ul>Replenishment Optimization: optimizing replenishment quantity per order to minimize the number of replenishments between warehouse and stores(Warehousing & Transportation Costs)</ul>

## Conclusion
The best time series ARIMA model resulted in a RMSE of 7.47, compared to an XGB and XGB Boosted models RMSE of .2 and .9 respectively. 
Next Step: reduce order frequency using this forecasting model to match order quantity with demand.
